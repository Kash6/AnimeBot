# AnimeBot

## Description
This project takes on the problem of transferring
the style of cartoon images to real-life photographic images by
implementing previous work done by CartoonGAN. We trained
a Generative Adversial Network(GAN) to convert real life pictures/faces to anime faces.
## Predict

Predict by running `predict.py`.

Example:

```
python predict.py -i C:/folder/input_image.png -o ./output_folder/output_image.png
